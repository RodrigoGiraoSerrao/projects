The point of this folder is to contain everything I created related to fractals

The .rar folders contain windows executables for the files of the same name;

For the Mandelbrot set, clicking the screen will zoom in the fractal on that point;
For the Julia set, clicking a point will create its filled Julia set; hitting the spacebar presents the user
  with the initial white screen with the 2 axis; hitting the left arrow goes back to previous filled Julia sets,
  hitting the right arrow goes forward again.

Note that the fractal of mandelbrotEvolutive becomes better than the one of mandelbrotConstant as you zoom in.
