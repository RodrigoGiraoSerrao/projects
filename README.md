This GitHub repo is supposed to hold every single script/project that I develop and reaches a stage where it works.

Everyone is welcome to fork this repo and use it.

When using any code from RojerGS, you are asked to refer back to this repo and give credit to RojerGS.

Contributions/suggestions are much appreciated!
