## What are the odds?

A short series of blog posts on [my blog](mathspp.com/blog) intended to show how some notions of probabilities and combinatorics can be rather counter-intuitive!

The files in this folder should contain simulations in Python to support the theoretical results I present and/or to estimate probabilities that I can't or do not want to compute by hand!
