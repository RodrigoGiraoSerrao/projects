This repo contains a maze solver, which is in Solver.py

Using it is really simple but you need both Pillow and pygame; for those reasons I made a standalone executable. You execute either
the .py or the .exe and it will ask you for the path of the maze you want to solve (an image). After that you click the
point you want to go from and the point you want to go to. It will ask for your confirmation. If you accept, the program
will attempt to draw a red path from one point to the other. If it fails because he finds no such path, it will let you know.
