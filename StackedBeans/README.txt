In https://mathspp.blogspot.com/2018/02/problem-06-stacks-of-beans.html you can find a "mathematical" game described

In these files you find scripts to play the game against two kinds of opponents:
  - a weak one with no good strategy;
  - a perfect player following the optimal strategy;
  
The reason there are two separate files is because the game was first implemented in REPL.it so it could be played online
by the people reading the linked blog post.
