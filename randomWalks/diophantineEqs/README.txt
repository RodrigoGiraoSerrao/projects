You can read a little bit more about this folder at:
https://mathspp.blogspot.pt/2017/10/random-walks-to-solve-diophantine.html

The files here try to use random walks to solve Diophantine equations.
The generatePartition.m and pickSubinterval.m are auxiliary functions for both
the other two files, that contain the actual simulations. The first one
solves equations of the form Ax+By=C, while the second one tries to solve
instances of the Erdos-Straus conjecture:

every n >= 2 is such that (x,y,z) integers exist yielding 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z
