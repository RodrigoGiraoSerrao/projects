If we manage to characterize the \"inverse of $d$\" we may be able to generalize it to modular arithmetic. The inverse of $d$ is a special number $q$ (which we denote by $d^{-1}$) with the amazing property that $qd = dq = 1$. In modular arithmetic, we will define the inverse of a number $n$ as the number $n^{-1}$ such that $n^{-1}n = nn^{-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the inverse of $2$ modulo $3$ is $2$, because $2\\times2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\mod{3}$. Some other examples include $10^{-1} = 4 \\mod{13}$, $5^{-1} = 5 \\mod{6}$ and $7^{-1} = 10 \\mod{23}$.\n",

    "When we are dealing with regular division in $\\mathbb{R}$, the only number that does not have an inverse is $0$. When we are dealing with modular arithmetic in $\\mathbb{Z}_m$, $0$ doesn't have an inverse. But it may happen that, in $\\mathbb{Z}_m$, other numbers cannot have an inverse. Take $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ as an example; we will see now that $2$ cannot have an inverse in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$: let us call $n$ to the potential inverse of $2$, then $2n \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$. But regardless of the $n$ we choose, $2n$ will always be an even number, while $x \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$ has to be odd. (In fact if a number $x$ is equivalent to $1$ modulo $m$, then $x$ has to be of the form $x = km + 1$ for some integer $k$.)\n",
